## Operation
Click on the calculator's keys and calculate simple expressions.

## Tech/Libraries Used
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React

## Problems/Solutions
* There were many small challenges with trying to parse something on my own. I relied on regular expressions, and conditionals to make the expressions work properly.
